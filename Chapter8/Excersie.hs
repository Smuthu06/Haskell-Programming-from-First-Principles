True]]?
a) Bool
b) mostly True
c) [a]
d) [[Bool]]

Answer :  d

2. Which of the following has the same type as [[True, False],
[True, True], [False, True]]?
a) [(True, False), (True, True), (False, True)]
b) [[3 == 3], [6 > 5], [3 < 4]]
c) [3 == 3, 6 > 5, 3 < 4]
d) ["Bool", "more Bool", "Booly Bool!"]

Answer : a

3. For the following function
func :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
func x y = x ++ y
which of the following is true?
a) x and y must be of the same type
b) x and y must both be lists
c) if x is a String then y must be a String
d) all of the above

Answer : d

4. For the func code above, which is a valid application of
func to both of its arguments?
a) func "Hello World"
b) func "Hello" "World"
c) func [1, 2, 3] "a, b, c"
d) func ["Hello", "World"]

Answer : b

Write a function that recursively sums all numbers from
1 to n, n being the argument. So that if n was 5, youâ€™d add
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 to get 15. The type should be (Eq a, Num a)
=> a -> a.-}

mySum 1 = 1
mySum n = n + mySum (n-1)
